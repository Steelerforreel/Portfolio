              <p>Hi i'm Nick and i'd like to introduce you to my webpage with all of my experience and current coding projects i'm working on. I first started my coding journey in August of 2023. I've come to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript and I'm continuing my journey to understand more about Full-Stack Web Development.</p>

                <pre class="picture-block"><ul>Sr. Loss Mitigation Specialist</ul>
                </pre>
                <ul>Upstart · Full-time</ul>
                <ul>Dec 2021 - Present · 1 year 9 months</ul> 
                <ul>Columbus, Ohio, United States</ul>
                <p>At Upstart the core values majorly come down to quality while meeting your projected goal each day.</p>
                <p>Here I exceed the goals given to me and maintain 100% quality everyday.</p>  
                <p>While managing to compete with the top performers, my goal is to better the company and process in which we work in.</p>  
                <p>I take every opportunity to learn different departments and help with any special projects that are required.</p>  
                <p>I'm currently one of the leaders of an extracurricular committee known as the Onboarding Committee, focused on career building, encouraging cross functionality and creating a bond between coworkers. In this committee I lead presentations interviewing different managers across different departments to better understand how Upstart works and to pique interest in the minds of Upstarters that may be curious. In these presentations known as the Nitty Gritty, I am able to better understand how our leaders have obtained their roles and what brought them to this point.</p> 
                <p>In my current role as a Sr. Hardship Specialist I have sought out to bring employee relations together and try to create a closer group that way we are all holding each other accountable and not fearing asking for help to get ever closer to our own individual goals.</p>  
                <p>Skills: Critical Thinking · Problem Solving · Teamwork</ul>

              <p>For my first project I have made a Cheatsheet for CSS that display various styling properties that display the code to create it inside the text boxes below each property.</p>

              <p>For my next project I worked with a partner to create a music discovering application that allows you to find your favorite music by searching for a random genre using Spotifys API. We also added a Random Genre Generator to go along with it as well!.</p>
