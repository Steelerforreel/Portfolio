Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio that describes my current occupation as well as all of my current web development projects.

Project Description:
I have created a website that includes all of current projects as well as my occupation and contact information. I intend on uploading more content to this as my knowledge grows and I intend on updating everything I can. As I become more accustomed to the new features I learn, I will continue to add more.

#Credits

I would like to thank my teacher Matthew Miller at edx for helping me fine tune the process and help me get this project in working order.
